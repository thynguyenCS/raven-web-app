# Project Description
This app's purpose is to provide a platform where users can easily find information about any particular vendor. Knowing whether if a vendor is a good candidate for a project is a complicated and time-consuming process because most of the information about them is not available online. We are far from finishing the project but we hope to complete it in the upcoming months.
